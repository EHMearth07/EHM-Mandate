    <h1>Ecological Human Mandate (EHM)</h1>
    <p>The Ecological Human Mandate (EHM) is a bold initiative to realign human civilization with its natural, scientific, and social origins. Our world today is plagued by ecological destruction, political greed, and social division. The time has come to rise—not with destruction—but with visionary transformation. This mandate is not just an ideology; it's a new way of life, a constitution for Earth based on science, reason, ecology, and human harmony.</p><p>We believe that humanity, in its purest form, is not meant to exploit but to sustain. Nature never designed us to create castes, divisions, or ideological prisons. We are children of Earth, and Earth must once again be our guide. Through this mandate, we seek to redefine civilization, governance, and consciousness itself. Welcome to the Earth Order—a world governed not by greed, not by dogma, but by balance and purpose.</p>

<div class="rules">
  <h2>Ten Foundational Principles of EHM</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Science and ecological balance are the supreme laws of the land.</li>
    <li>All humans are equal; caste, race, and religion have no say in policy or law.</li>
    <li>Power is given only to those who understand and follow ecological truths.</li>
    <li>Religion is private and sacred; it must never cross into politics or lawmaking.</li>
    <li>Greed in any form is punishable. A society of takers collapses; we are givers.</li>
    <li>Natural affection, love, and emotional well-being are encouraged in safe, respectful ways.</li>
    <li>The Earth is sacred. Any exploitation of nature without regeneration is banned.</li>
    <li>Weapons and war must be replaced with education and innovation.</li>
    <li>Leadership is earned through vision, not wealth or inheritance.</li>
    <li>Voices are heard. But those that disturb nature or divide society will be corrected—with peace or power.</li>
  </ol>
